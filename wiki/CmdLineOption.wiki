CmdLineOption is a helper class that allows you to easily parse commandline options.

Simply create a CmdLineOption object and add known options to it by calling:

{{{
CmdLineOption.append(....)
}}}

Once the object has been properly set up you can call parse to parse the command line options.

Because CmdLineOption knows all the valid options, it can print a help text for you by calling:

{{{
CmdLineOption.printHelp()
}}}
